## Openings

The Huang Lab currently has multiple openings for prospective graduate students and postdoctoral scholars (see below). A goal of our research lab is to train interdisciplinary scientists with in-depth knowledge of both genomics and machine learning. 
We welcome applicants from diverse academic backgrounds, including biology, bioinformatics, genomics, computer science, statistics, and other quantitative disciplines. Please feel free to contact <a href="mailto:yuh371@psu.edu">Dr. Yifei Huang</a> if you are interested in joining the lab.

### Postdoc position

An NIH-funded postdoctoral position is available immediately in the Huang Lab. The postdoctoral scholar will develop and apply evolution-guided machine learning models to infer natural selection acting on genes and cis-regulatory elements. Potential applications of the research include, but are not limited to, prioritizing pathogenic variants and examining the genomic basis of human adaptive evolution. The ideal candidates will have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree, with relevant training in at least one field related to population genomics, comparative genomics, functional genomics, molecular evolution, statistics, and/or machine learning. Experience in analyzing large-scale population/comparative genomic data or implementing machine learning/statistical models is a plus. Interested candidates are invited to send CV to <a href="mailto:yuh371@psu.edu">Dr. Yifei Huang</a> and apply on <a href="https://psu.wd1.myworkdayjobs.com/en-US/PSU_Academic/job/University-Park-Campus/Postdoctoral-Scholar---Huang-Lab_REQ_0000016863-2">Penn State Career website</a>. Review of applications will begin immediately and continue until the position is filled.

### PhD studentship

Multiple fully funded positions are available in the Huang Lab for prospective PhD students. PhD students in the Huang Lab will receive training in genomics, statistics, and machine learning to tackle fundamental questions in population genomics, human genomics, computational biology, and molecular evolution.
Prospective students are invited to send their CV and transcript(s) to <a href="mailto:yuh371@psu.edu">Dr. Yifei Huang</a>. Prospective students should also apply to <a href="https://bio.psu.edu/graduate-portal/join-our-program/the-biology-graduate-program-at-penn-state">the Biology Program</a>, <a href="https://www.huck.psu.edu/graduate-programs/bioinformatics-and-genomics">the Bioinformatics and Genomics Program</a>, or <a href="https://www.huck.psu.edu/graduate-programs/molecular-cellular-and-integrative-biosciences">the Molecular, Cellular, and Integrative Biosciences Program</a> at Penn State. 
We do not expect that students have already mastered both biology and computation before joining the lab. GRE is not required for graduate admission to Penn State.
