## Open positions

The Huang Lab currently has multiple openings for prospective graduate students and postdoctoral scholars (see below). A goal of our research lab is to train interdisciplinary scientists equipped with in-depth knowledge in both genomics and machine learning. 
We welcome applicants from diverse academic backgrounds, including biology, bioinformatics, computer science, mathematics, statistics, and other quantitative disciplines. Feel free to contact <a href="mailto:yuh371@psu.edu">Dr. Yifei Huang</a> if you are interested in joining the lab.

### Postdoc opening

An NIH-funded postdoctoral position is available immediately in Huang Lab. Interested scholars are invited to apply on <a href="https://psu.wd1.myworkdayjobs.com/en-US/PSU_Academic/job/University-Park-Campus/Postdoctoral-Scholar---Huang-Lab_REQ_0000016863-2">the Penn State Career website</a>. For further information, please email <a href="mailto:yuh371@psu.edu">Dr. Yifei Huang</a>. Review of applications will begin immediately and continue until the position is filled.

### PhD student opening

Students interested in PhD positions should contact <a href="mailto:yuh371@psu.edu">Dr. Yifei Huang</a> and apply to <a href="https://bio.psu.edu/graduate-portal/join-our-program/the-biology-graduate-program-at-penn-state">the Biology Program</a>, <a href="https://www.huck.psu.edu/graduate-programs/bioinformatics-and-genomics">the Bioinformatics and Genomics Program</a>, or <a href="https://www.huck.psu.edu/graduate-programs/molecular-cellular-and-integrative-biosciences">the Molecular, Cellular, and Integrative Biosciences Program</a> at Penn State. 
We emphasize motivation and do not expect that students have already mastered both biology and computation before joining the lab. 


<!--
We are always looking for new group members with passion, talent, and grit!

You will have the chance to work on the grand challenges of condensed matter physics, often at the interface of instrumental design and new physics. You will be involved in determining the important and interesting questions, creating and improving instrumental setups, performing measurements, and making discoveries.

### Master projects for Leiden University students
If you are a Master student at Leiden University looking for a Master project, contact me (or any group member) per email or stop by my office.

### Bsc / Master students from elsewhere
If you are interested in pursuing a Master degree at Leiden University, see [mastersinleiden.nl](http://www.mastersinleiden.nl/programmes/physics/en/introduction). Sometimes, we take master students or summer interns if we get exceptional applicants (this usually means very good grades and a personal recommendation).
